                <h2>Cactus</h2>
                <p>A cactus (cacti, cactuses, or less commonly, cactus) is a member of the 
                plant family Cactaceae,a family comprising about 127 genera with some 1,750 known 
                species of the order Caryophyllales.The word cactus derives, through Latin, 
                from the Ancient Greek word κάκτος (káktos), a name originally used by Theophrastus for a spiny 
                plant whose identity is now not certain.Cacti occur in a wide range of shapes and sizes.<br><br>
                They are native to the Americas, ranging from Patagonia in the south to parts of western Canada 
                in the north, with the exception of Rhipsalis baccifera, which is also found in Africa and Sri Lanka.<br><br>
                Cacti are adapted to live in very dry environments, including the Atacama Desert, one of the driest 
                places on Earth. Because of this, cacti show many adaptations to conserve water. For example, 
                almost all cacti are succulents, meaning they have thickened, fleshy parts adapted to store water.<br><br>
                Unlike many other succulents, the stem is the only part of most cacti where this vital process takes place. 
                Most species of cacti have lost true leaves, retaining only spines, which are highly 
                modified leaves. As well as defending against herbivores, spines help prevent water loss by reducing 
                air flow close to the cactus and providing some shade. 
                In the absence of true leaves, cacti's enlarged stems carry out photosynthesis.</p><br><br>

                <h2>Golden Barrel Cactus</h2>
                <p>Kroenleinia grusonii, popularly known as the golden barrel cactus, golden ball, "mother-in-law's cushion"
                or "mother-in-law’s chair" is a species of barrel cactus which is endemic to east-central Mexico.<br><br>
                The golden barrel cactus is rare and endangered—potentially regionally extinct—in nature. 
                It is native to the Mexican states of Querétaro and Hidalgo, particularly near Mesa de León.
                Wild populations of K. grusonii were adversely affected in the 1990s as a result of wild specimens being poached 
                as well as the creation of the Zimapán Dam and reservoir (in Hidalgo).<br><br>
                The golden barrel cactus is a fairly adaptable species, but naturally prefers growing in rich, volcanic (but well-aerated) soil on sunny 
                slopes, where water quickly flees from its roots. 
                The species may be found growing at altitudes as high as 1,400 metres (4,600 ft) above sea level.</p>

                <h2>Bunny Ears Cactus</h2>
                <p>Opuntia microdasys forms a dense shrub 40–60 cm tall, occasionally more, composed of pad-like stems 6–15 cm long and 4–12 cm broad.<br><br>

                    Instead of spines it has numerous white or yellow glochids 2–3 mm long in dense clusters. They are barbed and thinner than the finest human hairs, 
                    detaching in large numbers upon the slightest touch. If not removed they will cause considerable 
                    skin irritation so the plants must be treated with caution.<br><br>
                    
                    The Latin specific epithet microdasys means "small and hairy".<br><br>
                    
                    The yellow flowers appear only rarely. Despite this, it is a very popular cactus in cultivation, 
                    partly because of the young plant's comical resemblance to a rabbit's head. 
                    It has gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.</p>
